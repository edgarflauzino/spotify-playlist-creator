# Spotify Playlist Creator

Spotify Playlist Creator is a educational project that is part of Codecademy's Full Stack Engineer course. It aims to create a fully operational web app using React and fetching API data from Spotify to search for tracks and create a personalized playlist. After finishing setting up the playlist, the user can upload it to his Spotify account.

## Installation

You must have node.js and react installed. Use the terminal in the react app folder to deploy the app locally.

```bash
npm start
```

## Usage

On the front page, search for track names, artists or albums in the search bar and click search.
Once Spotify authenticates your user, your search will return a list of tracks. Clicking '+' will add the track to the playlist. You can remove tracks from the playlist by clicking '-' as well.
The playlist name can be changed. When you are done, just add the playlist to Spotify!
