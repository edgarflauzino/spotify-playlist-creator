# Spotify Playlist Creator

Spotify Playlist Creator is a educational project that is part of Codecademy's Full Stack Engineer course. It aims to create a fully operational web app using React and fetching API data from Spotify to search for tracks and creating a personalized playlist. After all tracks are selected, the user can upload the playlist to his Spotify account.

## Installation

As this is a react app, you must have node.js and react installed. Use the terminal in the react app folder to deploy the app locally.

```bash
npm start
```

## Usage

The app is easy to understand, search for track names, artists or albums in the search bar and click search.
Once Spotify authenticates your user, your search will return a list of tracks, and clicking '+' those can be added to a personalised playlist. You can remove tracks from the playlist by clicking '-' as well.
The playlist name can be changed. After the user finish setting up the playlist, just add the playlist to Spotify!
